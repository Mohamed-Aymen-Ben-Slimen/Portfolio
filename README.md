# Portfolio Website
This repository features the source code for my personal portfolio website. 
## About
This website is built using **TypeScript** and **SCSS**, transpiled quickly using **Gulp** build tools. I opted away from any frameworks to experience what creating an interactive web page from scratch feels like.
## Process
Originally, I was writing my source code in ES6 JavaScript using the Babel transpiler. However, I began to realize I was unable to achieve the quality, control, and organization over my code I was aiming for. I quickly converted everything over to TypeScript; it was now easier to communicate internal states and HTML elements across multiple files.

I designed my SVG logo using **Figma**.

The particle effects are heavily based on [VincentGarreau's particles.js framework](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js). My goal was to re-imagine his framework using classes and internal states. Type annotations via TypeScript also help a lot in creating the configuration settings.
